This is the project I created to model a generalized Fourier transformation.

For the first part of this project during college as a mathematical piece, I created Transform, which only 
showed transformations that came from regular n-sided polygons. This largely involved establishing sine and
cosine functions and then convoluting them into a fourier transformation that all had them revolve around
each other. For this project, I made it so that it took those sine and cosine functions for any given polygon
that could be represented as a polar function on a two-dimensional plane, regardless of whether they were 
regular or not.

In terms of application, this could be used for finding things like the positions of electrons, modeling planets
in a solar system, building simulations, or video games. For instance, if a person wanted to see if some object
were colliding with a circle, they might be able to do that by saying the object's coordinates have that
x <= cos(t), y <= sin(t) for a given angle of collision t, and with this being generalized for any given shape
in polar coordinates, the problem would then be easy, and you could generalize it further for all polygons by just
building one adjacently to another. It also looks pretty.
